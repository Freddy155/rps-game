## Introduction
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game that is typically played between two people. This Python implementation allows you to play against the computer with a simple GUI.

## Setup
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed and the tkinter library available. If not, you can install tkinter using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
```
After setting up the environment, you can run the Python script to start the game.

## Game Rules
The game follows the traditional rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

In case both the player and the computer choose the same item, it's a tie.

## How to play
1. Launch the game.
You will see a GUI with three buttons: "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."
2. Click one of the buttons to make your choice.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The result will be displayed on the GUI, indicating whether you won, the computer won, or it's a tie.

## Code overview

The code for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is divided into two main parts:

GUI setup: This section initializes the GUI window and creates buttons for the game options.

Game logic: It includes functions to determine the winner based on the player's choice and the computer's random choice. The result is displayed on the GUI.

Enjoy playing Rock-Paper-Scissors!
